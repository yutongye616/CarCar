## Service Microservice

The Service microservice features three main models: `Technician`, `AutomobileVO`, and `Appointment`. The `AutomobileVO` model includes a `vin` field, but it isn't linked as a foreign key to the `vin` field on `Appointment`. Within the `service` directory, the `poll` subdirectory contains `poller.py`, which fetches the `vin` and `sold` fields from the inventory microservice.

The Service microservice keeps track of technicians, tracks the status of service appointments, and maintains a service history that can be searched by a vehicle's VIN. It also supports adding new technicians and scheduling new appointments.

### Service API Endpoints

| Action | Method | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List Technicians | GET | `http://localhost:8080/api/technicians/` |
| Create a Technician | POST | `http://localhost:8080/api/technicians/` |
| Delete a Specific Technician | DELETE | `http://localhost:8080/api/technicians/<id>/` |
| List Appointments | GET | `http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/` |
| Create an Appointment | POST | `http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/` |
| Delete a Specific Appointment | DELETE | `http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/<id>/` |

### Technicians

The Technician API provides three endpoints: GET, POST, and DELETE. These can be accessed via a web browser or an API client like Insomnia.

Each technician has an auto-generated `id`, a `first_name` and `last_name`, and an `employee_id` — a unique number the company uses to track pay and work schedules.

**GET** `http://localhost:8080/api/technicians/`

No JSON body required. Returns a list of technicians.

```json
Example Response:
{
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Ye",
    "employee_id": 123
}
```

**POST** `http://localhost:8080/api/technicians/`

Creates a new technician.

```json
Example Request Body:
{
    "first_name": "Yutong",
    "last_name": "Ye",
    "employee_id": 123
}

Example Response:
{
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "Yutong",
    "last_name": "Ye",
    "employee_id": 123
}
```

**DELETE** `http://localhost:8080/api/technicians/<id>/`

Removes a technician. Substitute `<id>` with the technician's unique ID.

```json
Example Response:
{
    "message": "Technician has been deleted"
}
```

### Appointments

The Appointment API offers three endpoints: GET, POST, and DELETE.

Each appointment has a unique `id` and includes the appointment time (`date_time`), reason (`service_reason`), and customer name. It's linked to a vehicle by `vin` and flags whether the customer is a priority (`vip`). The assigned technician is referenced by ID.

**GET** `http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/`

No JSON body required. Returns a list of appointments.

```json
Example Response:
{
    "appointments": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "vin": "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
            "vip": false,
            "date_time": "2024-02-10T14:00:00+00:00",
            "customer": "Jane Smith",
            "service_reason": "Regular maintenance",
            "status": "Scheduled",
            "techname": "John Ye"
        }
    ]
}
```

**POST** `http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/`

Creates a new appointment.

```json
Example Request Body:
{
    "date_time": "2024-02-10T14:00:00Z",
    "service_reason": "Regular maintenance",
    "status": "Scheduled",
    "vin": "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
    "customer": "Jane Smith",
    "vip": true,
    "technician": 2
}

Example Response:
{
    "appointments": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "vin": "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
            "vip": false,
            "date_time": "2024-02-10T14:00:00+00:00",
            "customer": "Jane Smith",
            "service_reason": "Regular maintenance",
            "status": "Scheduled",
            "techname": "John Ye"
        }
    ]
}
```

**DELETE** `http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/<id>/`

Removes an appointment. Substitute `<id>` with the appointment's unique ID.

```json
Example Response:
{
    "message": "Appointment has been deleted."
}
```

## Sales Microservice

The Sales microservice contains four models:

* **AutomobileVO** — mirrors the `vin` and `sold` fields from the Inventory microservice's `Automobile` model.
* **Customer** — a potential buyer of a vehicle.
* **Salesperson** — a staff member who sells vehicles on the lot.
* **Sale** — a record of a completed sale.

`AutomobileVO` is kept in sync by a poller that pulls the VIN and `sold` status from Inventory every 60 seconds.

The endpoints below can be called directly (e.g. with Insomnia); otherwise they're used through the front end.

### Sales API Endpoints

| Action | Method | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List Customers | GET | `http://localhost:8090/api/customers/` |
| Create a Customer | POST | `http://localhost:8090/api/customers/` |
| Delete a Specific Customer | DELETE | `http://localhost:8090/api/customers/<id>/` |
| List Salespeople | GET | `http://localhost:8090/api/salespeople/` |
| Create a Salesperson | POST | `http://localhost:8090/api/salespeople/` |
| Delete a Specific Salesperson | DELETE | `http://localhost:8090/api/salespeople/<id>/` |
| List Sales | GET | `http://localhost:8090/api/sales/` |
| Create a Sale | POST | `http://localhost:8090/api/sales/` |
| Delete a Specific Sale | DELETE | `http://localhost:8090/api/sales/<id>/` |

> Delete functionality is not yet implemented in the front end.

### Creating Records

**Create Customer**

```json
{
    "first_name": "Josh",
    "last_name": "Elder",
    "address": "69420 Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA 98102",
    "phone_number": "1231231234"
}
```

The response mirrors the request with an added `id` property.

**Create Salesperson**

```json
{
    "first_name": "Jaik",
    "last_name": "Ascher",
    "employee_id": "jascher"
}
```

`employee_id` is the first initial followed by the lowercase last name. The response mirrors the request with an added `id` property.

**Create a Sale**

```json
{
    "price": 1000000,
    "automobile": "1D7HA18N33J33J665",
    "salesperson": "jascher",
    "customer": "Josh"
}
```

`automobile` is the vehicle's 17-character VIN, `salesperson` is the salesperson's employee ID, and `customer` is the customer's first name.

```json
Example Response:
{
    "id": 16,
    "price": 1000000,
    "automobile": {
        "id": 4,
        "vin": "1D7HA18N33J33J665",
        "sold": false
    },
    "salesperson": {
        "id": 5,
        "first_name": "Jaik",
        "last_name": "Ascher",
        "employee_id": "jascher"
    },
    "customer": {
        "id": 4,
        "first_name": "Josh",
        "last_name": "Elder",
        "address": "69420 Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA 98102",
        "phone_number": "1231231234"
    }
}
```

To delete a sale, salesperson, or customer, append its `id` to the corresponding URL above and submit a DELETE request.
